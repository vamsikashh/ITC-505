                    <h3>1.AUTOMATIC LICENSE NUMBER PLATE RECOGNITION USING DEEP LEARNING</h3>
                    <p>The Scope of the project is to recognise the license number plate using python pro- gramming with the help of OpenCV and Pytesseract libraries.
                        License Plate recognition is one of the techniques used for vehicle identification pur- poses. The sole intention of this project is to find the 
                        most efficient way to recognize the registration information from the digital image (obtained from the camera). This process usually comprises of three steps. First step is the license plate localization, 
                        regardless of the license-plate size and orientation. The second step is the segmen- tation of the characters and last step is the recognition of the
                         characters from the license plate. Thus, this project uncovers the fundamental idea of various algorithms required to accomplish character recognition from the license plate during Template Matching.</p>

                         <p>
                            This feature of the algorithm mentioned above helped in achieving faster character recognition of the license plate. This process of character recognition consists of steps like Image processing,
                             Defragmentation, Resizing and Character localization that are required to be performed on the image in order for Template Matching to be done

                    <h3>2.Biometric and Facial Authentication for Voting Machine</h3>
                    <p>The project aims to revolutionize the security and reliability of voting systems through the implementation of biometric and facial recognition technologies. By integrating advanced biometric authentication methods 
                        like fingerprint scanning and facial recognition into traditional voting machines, the project seeks to bolster the integrity of electoral processes. This solution will ensure that only authorized voters 
                        can participate, thereby minimizing the risks associated with identity fraud and unauthorized voting activities.</p>
                        <p>

                            <b>Key Objectives:</b><br>

<b>Enhanced Security</b>: Implementing robust biometric authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of voters, ensuring that only eligible individuals can cast their votes.<br>

<b> Accurate Identification</b>: Utilizing facial recognition technology to accurately authenticate voters, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the voting process.
